        <h1>Plane Algebraic Curves</h1>
        <p class="big">Welcome to the course website for the advanced course on plane algebraic curves at <a href="https://rossprogram.org/">Ross</a>/Ohio 2024. This course is intended as an introduction to classical algebraic geometry for second-year students (i.e. peer mentors) and counselors at Ross.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

            <li><b>Instructor</b>: Dhruv Goel [<tt><a href="mailto:gauravgoel@college.harvard.edu">gauravgoel@college.harvard.edu</a></tt>]
            <li><b>Meeting Times and Locations</b>: 4:30 - 5:30 pm on MWF, in Roush 114 (first week only; location starting the second week TBD).
            <li><b>Office Hours</b>: TBD
            <li><b>Topics Covered</b>: <em>The course topics will be adjusted based on the backgrounds and interests of the participants.</em> A tentative list of topics can be found <a href="curves.html#topics">below</a>.
            <li><b>Texts/References</b>: I will type up <a href="curves.html#notes">my own lecture notes</a>. For other references, see <a href="curves.html#references">the section below</a>.
            <li><b>Prerequisites</b>: The only real prerequisite is familiarity with the fundamentals of ring/field theory (prime and irreducible elements, ideals, algebraically closed fields). Familiarity with linear algebra and topology will occasionally be useful, but is not required.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
            <li><b>Assignments and Collaboration Policy</b>: There are no formal assignments, although I will produce <a href="curves.html#exercises">weekly exercise sheets</a>. You do not need to turn in solutions, but you are welcome to discuss your solutions with me as well. You are highly encouraged to read the <a href="curves.html#notes">lecture notes</a> carefully and to attempt each problem in the exercise sheets by yourself, having done which, collaboration and discussion with your peers is highly welcome and encouraged.
            <li><b>Graphing</b>: You are highly encouraged to make full use of wonderful graphing software such as <a href="https://www.desmos.com/">Desmos</a> and <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">WolframAlpha</a> to make your experience in this course more enjoyable.

        <sup id="fn1">1. This course is NOT for first-year students at Ross, and first-year students are generally not encouraged to take this course; if you are a first-year student who <em>really</em> wants to sit in, let me and your counselor know and we can discuss your specific situation.<a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>

        <sup id="fn2">2. If you would like to come to this course but are unsure about whether you have enough background, you probably do. Even if you don't, I believe that you will certainly gain something from coming to the lectures, even if you don't understand them fully. You are also welcome to write to me to discuss this.<a href="#ref2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩</a></sup>

        <h2>Topics Covered</h2>
  The current (tentative, possibly slightly ambitious) list of topics I plan to talk about is:
                <ol>
                    <li> Affine algebraic curves over an arbitrary field \(k\), coordinate rings, affine changes of coordinates
                    <li> Lots of examples (e.g. synthetic constructions, parametric and polar curves), digression on connections to other fields of math (e.g. number theory, complex analysis)
                    <li> The interplay between algebra and geometry: irreducibility, reducedness, finiteness of curve intersection using Gauss's Lemma, Nullstellensatz for \(\mathbb A^2_k\)
                    <li> Local properties: smoothness, tangent lines/cones, multiplicity of a point, rational functions, local rings, local intersection multiplicity
                    <li> Introduction to the projective plane and projective curves, points at infinity, (de)homogenization, projective changes of coordinates
                    <li> Classification of affine and projective conics over \(k=\mathbb C\)
                    <li> Theorems of Bezout and Max Noether and applications (Cayley-Bacharach Theorem, Pascal's Theorem, Pappus' Theorem)
                    <li> Classification of projective cubic curves and introduction to elliptic curves (e.g. associativity of group law)
                </ol>
                Further topics (if time permits) might include:
                <ol>
                    <li> Topology of real plane curves (connected components, convexity, nesting, Harnack's Theorem)
                    <li> Inflection points, polars and Hessians
                    <li> Pencils of conics, parameter spaces, solving the quartic equation using algebraic geometry
                    <li> More on elliptic curves (Weierstrass normal form, torsion points)
                    <li> Divisors and the Riemann-Roch Theorem (and applications)
                    <li> More singularity theory: conductors, knots, etc.

        <h2>Textbooks and References</h2>
        
        Some other useful references at a level similar to that of this course are:
            <ol>
                <li> <a href="https://agag-gathmann.math.rptu.de/en/curves.php">These lecture notes</a> by Andreas Gathmann for a similar course.
                <li> The first two chapters of Miles Reid's textbook <em>Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry</em>, (legally) available for free <a href="https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/Miles.Reid/MA4A5/UAG.pdf">here</a>.

                <li> The textbook titled <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-8176-4443-1"><em>Introduction to Plane Algebraic Curves</em></a> by Ernst Kunz.
            </ol>
        The following are more advanced textbooks suited for a full-scale undergraduate course on algebraic geometry:
        <ol start = 4>
            <li> Fulton's textbook titled  <a href="https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~wfulton/CurveBook.pdf"><em>Algebraic Curves</em></a>.
                <li> Harris's textbook titled <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-2189-8"><em>Algebraic Geometry: A First Course</em></a>. (Disclaimer: I'm slightly biased in my choices, since Harris was my advisor.)
        </ol>
        For a much more encyclopaedic but still fairly accessible treatment, I would recommend:
        <ol start = 6>
            <li>The book by Brieskorn and Knörrer titled <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-0348-5097-1"><em>Plane Algebraic Curves</em></a>.
        </ol>
